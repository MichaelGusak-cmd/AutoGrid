# AutoGrid
Game made for the Ludum Dare 50 game jam 

Completed Solo using Unity (C#) in 48 hours (Apr 2-4, 2022):

## [Play the Game!](https://obscenebard.itch.io/autogrid "https://obscenebard.itch.io/autogrid") 

AutoGrid is an autobattler with 2 types of rounds:
  Player Round: where the player selects a new unit from a randomized list of choices and where to place them on the grid
  Combat Round: Where the units 'battle' each other (with no possible input from the player)

The genre was chosen to incentivize strategic gameplay and the selection options limited to force the player to make interesting decisions that lead to a more engaging experience.

### Potential Future Updates:
  - Bugfix 1: Unit Status Display (Currently hardcoded values are not correct for every screen size)
  - Combat Round Animations: Slowing down the computations and having each unit 'act out' its moves will help build intuition and understanding of how the game works
  - Sounds: Adding sounds will create an audio indicator for each character's abilities, and improve the general *feel* of the game
  - Grid size scaling and general UI overhaul: As it is the UI is static and extremely barebones, putting effort into how the game interacts with the player will make the game drastically more fun to play

### Super Far off Updates:
  - More Tiles! Adding more tiles with new mechanics
  - More Characters! (eg. Characters that summon other characters!), a greater collection of units will raise the skill ceiling but also make it more fun and interesting
  - Character Animations!
  - Multiplayer! One idea is to have rounds bounce between players (eg. P1 Round -> Combat -> P2 Round -> Combat.. etc), or maybe each player could have their own individual grids and each player round they would try sabotage their opponent's board then try choose a unit for their own board to survive for the next round.
